    <h3>Space Exploration Technologies Corp.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
            Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American spacecraft manufacturer, 
            launcher, and a satellite communications corporation headquartered in 
            Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the stated 
            goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. 
            The company manufactures the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Starship launch vehicles, 
            several rocket engines, Cargo Dragon and Crew Dragon spacecraft, and Starlink 
            communications satellites.
        </p>  
        <p>
            SpaceX is developing a satellite internet constellation named Starlink 
            to provide commercial internet service. In January 2020, 
            the Starlink constellation became the largest satellite constellation 
            ever launched, and as of December 2022 comprises over 3,300 small satellites 
            in orbit. The company is also developing Starship, a privately funded, 
            fully reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for 
            interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. It is intended to become SpaceX's 
            primary orbital vehicle once operational, supplanting the existing Falcon 9, 
            Falcon Heavy, and Dragon fleet. It will have the highest payload capacity of any 
            orbital rocket ever built on its debut, which is scheduled for early 2023 
            pending a launch license.
        </p>

            SpaceX has made several achievements in space exploration. 
            These include making the first privately developed liquid-propellant 
            rocket that reached orbit, the first private company to launch, orbit, 
            and recover a spacecraft, the first private company to send a spacecraft 
            to the International Space Station, the first to achieve vertical propulsive 
            landing of an orbital rocket booster, the first to reuse such a booster, 
            and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to the 
            International Space Station. In addition, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets 
            have been flown and landed over one hundred times.
